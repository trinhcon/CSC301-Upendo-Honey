# Upendo Honey Promotional App

This app is designed as a promotional web application for raising awareness of
the benefits and perks of tanzanian honey. It begins with a code acquired from
the label on a purchase/promotion of Upendo Honey products. The label brings
the user to this website, where they can enter an alphanumeric code into the
input on the landing page. Alternatively, on the label we can place a QR code
on the label, which will link to an URL which has the alphanumeric code
embedded. In the case the user does not have a code to enter, a default code
is provided ("PUREJOY") for the user to enter.

Once the code has been received it will bring the user to the menu page with
a choice to go down various flows. Each flow has a unique topic for the user
to explore in depth and is customized according the the code they entered.
The flows contains various figures and facts explaining why tanzanian honey
is better than locally sourced honey. The user can choose which topics on the
honey they wish to explore and they can enter/exit these flows whenever they
like. Many flows (and the menu page) also contain external links for
additional information. Upendo Honey will manage these external links on a 
separate website.

Note:
If a QR code is used, any point in the application can be the entry point
(not just the landing and/or menu page).

## Various Flows

* Honey Flow

  The user will learn about the health benefits of the type of honey which they
  purchased. They will also learn about how the honey is harvested and what
  certifications and standards the company meets in their harvest. There is
  an external link for recipes using Honey.

* Beekeeper Flow

  This flow contains a picture of one of the beekeepers who contributed to the
  batch of honey purchased by the consumer. It also contains a hand written
  letter from the beekeeper and corresponding translation. The user can learn
  about the lives of beekeepers in this flow and respond to them using the
  email form at the end of the flow.

* Tanzania Flow

  There is a Google Map in this flow which displays where the honey is
  harvested in Tanzania. The user can scroll/zoom around to discover where in
  the world their honey is harvested. It also describes geological/ecological
  facts about the tanzanian forest.

* Carbon Footprint Flow

  We can compare the carbon footprint of tanzanian honey against local honey
  sources in this flow. An adjustable graph describes the various carbon
  producing effects of manufacturing honey jars and illustrates where upendo
  honey has a greater and lower carbon footprint. This flow also has an
  external link to a site containing more information about the Upendo Honey's
  carbon footprint and their eco-friendly practices.
