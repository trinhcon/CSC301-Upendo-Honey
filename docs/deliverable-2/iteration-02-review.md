# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: July 13 5:00pm
 * Where: On Zoom

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.
Scheduling Tasks on a Trello Board
Schedulung Regular Meetings for standups and meeting with the partner
Communication with the BRD and over whatsapp with the partner

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

  1. Scheduling Regular Meetings and Standups with the partner:
    We Scheduled meetings with the partner every Tuesday morning and we scheduled
    regular standups twice a week for the development team. This decision was very
    helpful because it led to very consistent communication of new features and code
    infrastructure that was being developped. Each time we had a meeting we would
    record either in a ticket or in meeting minutes what was previously discussed.
    This was helpful in keeping track of progress between the development team members
    and prevent people from blocking eachother. In addition, this help with the
    clarification of feature details and implementation of those features among the
    entire team. A Sample artifact (meeting minutes) that resulted from this is show
    below:

```
Action Items:
    Partner to complete CO2 mock-up (and have a look at https://www.chartjs.org/samples/latest/
    Chart.js samples
    Area charts. Boundaries (line) Datasets (line)
    www.chartjs.org
    ) and add to BRD by the end of the day Thursday July 2nd

    Partner to organize tasks in BRD (COMPLETED)
    Partner to provide email information to front-end team via WhatsApp (COMPLETED)
    Linda to share Trello board with Partner (COMPLETED)
    Back-end to add fixing of api access to the backlog in Trello (COMPLETED)
    Front-end team to check information provided by Arno on Google Maps API and present thoughts
      by next week
    Back-end to confirm that Honey flow contains the required information for display based on
      Partner’s mockup in the BRD by next week

Decisions:
    Dev team to complete items according to priority list written in the BRD, trying to finish
      as much as they can (however we cannot guarantee completion of every item)
    Theme of the design flow is that of natural honey coming from the forest: naturesque, green
      and gold, less honey focused
    No particular attachment to the shape of the portrait, layout of icons on the menu, the
      icons used in the progress bar, the colour/shape of the next arrows

Meeting Minutes:
    Front-end presented the working version of the current design
        Links directly to the menu, partner is happy with the current functionality, just desires
          a change in aesthetics
        Email will information will be provided from partner so front-end can link it directly to them
    Update on the overall circumstances of the team, transfer of Natalia’s work to the rest of
      the team members
        Ashwin is handling most of the backend tasks, which were largely front-loaded.
        Conroy and Linda are handling the BRD, Trello and coordination tasks
        The deadline for the next deliverable is (small correction) given extenuating circumstances
          is July 16th rather than July 9th
        Team has created a list of tasks for the partner to prioritize in the BRD, the team will try
          their best to go through them in order of preference but there is no guarantee to finish
          every single one
    Discussion of aesthetics, changes and what to keep
        Would like to emphasize the branding as coming from the forest, natural, organic honey
        Very flexible on the way items are laid out in terms of size, positioning and filler so long
          as the forest theme is adhered to (i.e. using the leafy wallpaper and using green/gold
          aesthetic)
        Partner is aware that certain pages, such as the beekeeper and menu may look quite large on
          the desktop, so dev team will attempt to make appropriate adjustments
    In regards to specific elements of the design
        Landing Page: 
            Layout is fine, but would like to remove the bee to be coherent with the theme.
            Add the wallpaper filler instead.
        Beekeeper Flow: 
            No preference in terms of square or oval shape.
            Progress bar can be either the bee icons or a leaf, not particular attachment, can be
              different shapes or design as well
            Arrows can also be any design, so long as they match the theme (simpler is better)
        Forest Flow: 
            No major comments/questions from the dev team about the design.
            Dev team will follow Partner’s research on Google Maps API and get back by next meeting
              on how the zoom functionality will be incorporated (redesign to come first though)
        Honey Flow:
            Text will be configurable and come from the database (recipes will stay consistent)
            Back-end team to confirm the Honey model contains the required fields for front-end
              to display
            Honey harvesting and health information will be consistent for each flow
        CO2 Flow:  As confirmed earlier, will be consistent for each flow and provided within
          the next few days.
            Consider using less text for the flow, using infographic displays and less technical
              language
            Partner to look into Chart JS link to find graphs
            Idea of comparing the CO2 emissions between Upendo honey and the honey from other
              brands in a flow chart
    Backend presented the functionality of the admin side and api endpoints
        Slight issue with being able to modify api while not logged in, will be fixed
```

  2. Posting and Organizing Tasks as Tickets on Trello
    We simulated a pseudo scrum-kanban agile methodology using a trello board filled with
    tickets. Each ticket would represent either a user story or a key component that would
    lead to the completion of a user story. This process was very effective in organizing
    and planning progress of our project's development. We'd make "milestones" that are
    essentially sprints in scrum that would keep the project development at a steady pace.
    This also helps us keep track in terms of percentage of remaining work for the
    development team for the remainder of deliverable or the entire project. This was also
    particularly effective at helping us discuss specific features in detail because we
    could comment on the particular discussion that is local to each ticket. As a result
    communications, links and pictures could be easily found by finding the localized
    conversation on the ticket.

  3. Communication with partner through BRD and WhatsApp group chat
    We created a business requirements document (BRD) with our partner to specify what
    features are required in the project and the details of these features. This includes
    any possible features that our partners are currently speculating. This document has
    greatly helped in the narrowing the specifications for all features necessary for the
    project. To avoid confusion about changing features and specifications, we kept many
    of our final (or pending) decisions grouped into a single document. The document
    contains various details such as a database schema, application mockups and links
    to possible tools we would use for the project.

    A copy of the BRD is also placed in our documentation repository, please check the
    artifact for more details and references


#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

Communication issues between the frontend and backend development
Development in shorter iterations with the partner (they wanted a redesign)
Slack Channel division between slack


 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be unsuccessful
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).


#### Q3. Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)
We can add more slack channels
To present to the partner not with respect to deadlines but development


 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.


## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
 * How did you prepare your demo?
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * Did your partner accept the features?
 * Were there change requests?
 * What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?
 * *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed*
