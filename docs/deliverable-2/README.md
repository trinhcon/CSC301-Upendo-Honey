# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

> _Note:_ This document is intended to be relatively short. Be concise and precise. Assume the reader has no prior knowledge of your application and is non-technical. 

## Description 
 * Provide a high-level description of your application and it's value from an end-user's perspective

 The overall application is a promotion app mobile web app. The user is supposed to receive
 an alphanumeric code from the label of a retail product made from our partner's honey. The
 product would also have a URL that takes the user to our website. From the landing page of
 our website the user can enter the alphanumeric code printed on the retail product's label.
 Entering the code will take them to a menu of customized flows of websites slides. Each
 code is related to a batch of honey made from beekeepers; one of which who is written their
 own letter to the customer. The customer will be able to choose between a variety of topics
 to explore further in each flow. After they are finished reading they can read a different
 topic by selecting another one from the main menu.

 * What is the problem you're trying to solve?

 The objective of the application is to promote tazanian honey and raise awareness to allow
 the partners to have premium on their sales. They want to publicize unique features of
 their honey and their manufacturing process; particularly how closely they work with their
 beekeepers to produce honey in wild environments.

 * Is there any context required to understand **why** the application solves this problem?

 There is no special context required to understand why the application solves this problem.
 The project is straight forward and openly advertise information about Upendo Honey's
 produce.

## Key Features
 * Described the key features in the application that the user can access

 The key features involve entering a code in the landing page, being able to select the
 flow for their preferred topic from the meny page and be able to slide back and forth
 between slides in their selected flow. The entire app is designed to be exploratory
 depending on the user's preferences. The user will be able to see whichever flwo they
 choose 

 * Provide a breakdown or detail for each feature that is most appropriate for your application
 
 Additional interactive features include:
  * Submitting a form to send an email back to the beekeeper
  * Being able to access any point in the application through a valid URL. This means that a URL or QR code (with the URL inside)
    can be used to share specific portions of the application.
  * Mobile users can slide their phones screens, while desktop users can use buttons instead. (Responsive Web Deisgn)

 * This section will be used to assess the value of the features built

## Instructions
 * Clear instructions for how to use the application from the end-user's perspective



 * How do you access it? Are accounts pre-created or does a user register? Where do you start? etc. 
 * Provide clear steps for using each feature described above
 * This section is critical to testing your application and must be done carefully and thoughtfully
 
 ## Development requirements
 * If a developer were to set this up on their machine or a remote server, what are the technical requirements (e.g. OS, libraries, etc.)?
 * Briefly describe instructions for setting up and running the application (think a true README).
 
 ## Deployment and Github Workflow

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow. Essentially, we want to understand how your team members shares a codebase, avoid conflicts and deploys the application.

 * Be concise, yet precise. For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Describe your overall deployment process from writing code to viewing a live applicatioon
 * What deployment tool(s) are you using and how
 * Don't forget to **briefly explain why** you chose this workflow or particular aspects of it!

 ## Licenses 

 Keep this section as brief as possible. You may read this [Github article](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository) for a start.

 * What type of license will you apply to your codebase?
 * What affect does it have on the development and use of your codebase?
 * Why did you or your partner make this choice?
